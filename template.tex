\chapter{Introduction}

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be used for a multitude of complex tasks such as surveillance, reconnaissance, aerial photography, delivery, and for defense. Accomplishing these tasks require robust and fast execution of three distinct subsystems consisting of navigation, guidance, and control. 
\section{Motivation and Problem Statement}

%UAVs commercially available, ease of use, inexpensive, open source community, wells supported

\section{Methods Overview}
\section{Phases}
\section{Summary of Objectives}
\begin{itemize}

\item Develop a parameterized circulation method that eliminates the singularity and guides a UAV around an obstacle and to a target. The parametrized circulation term $f(heading,closing velocity, position, turn rate)$ and would be determined by minimizing a cost.


\item Simulate and compare the parametrized circulation with a non parametrized VF guidance for circular and elliptical obstacles

\item Emulate fixed wing algorithm with a ground robot to validate simulation results and demonstrate real time VF guidance is achievable with parametrized circulation modification


\end{itemize}





\chapter{Literature Review}
\section{Unmanned Aerial Vehicles}

In literature, UAVs generally occupy one of two categories consisting of fixed wing aircraft and multi-rotor aircraft. Fixed wing aircraft can carry a large payload and are ideal for long endurance missions, whereas multi-rotor aircraft are used when hovering or high maneuverability is desired. Both categories of vehicles require navigation, guidance, and control to maintain flight and accomplish their task. These processes are often automated and programmed into flight controllers that are placed on-board the aircraft itself. 

 - Tasks (path following, waypoint navigation, loitering)

\subsection{Flight Mechanics}

- Lift
- Thrust
- Drag

- Kinematics
- Dubins equations of motion
- Dynamics
- Need more literature

- Forward velocity constraints, turn rate constraints
- Transition could be the autopilot ensures that the vehicle does not violate these constraints or attempt to
- Autopilot (combindation of hardware and software, takes mission objectives and produces necessary actuator output)



\section{Navigation}
Before commanding a vehicle to a given task it is paramount that the location of a vehicle with respect to some reference point is known. Measuring, filtering, and estimating the location of a vehicle generally falls under the study of navigation. Commanding a vehicles heading and general operation is provided by a guidance system. Maintaining vehicle stability and reducing any errors is the responsibility of a control system. 

Sensor packages containing GPS receivers, barometers, and compasses measure the location and heading of a vehicle. Data is always subject to uncertainty caused by process and measurement noise. Filtering measurements with Kalman filters produce estimates that more accurately represent the location and heading.

\section{Guidance and Control}

Guidance and control are intermingled in many UAV systems. . . etc

	\item Potential field (what is it) (edge of bowl, marble, goal, obstacles)

	\item VF usefulness extended to loitering about an uncertain target
	\item Lyapunov vector field generation for a circular loiter
	\item Linear transformation applied to stretch the field into an ellipse shape
\end{itemize}




\section{Simulation and Emulation}
- As new features and improvements are made to the autopilot software, it is often useful to test the performance of the software in a virtual environment. The process of simulating the autopilot software is called Software in the Loop (SITL).

An additional testbed for new navigation, guidance, and control algorithms is the method of emulation. Emulation is the process of mimicking the kinematics of a complex dynamic system on a simplified system. Fixed wing UAV emulation has been observed in \cite{louali_designing_2014}, \cite{ren_experimental_2007}, and \cite{louali_experimental_2016}.

%- Hardware and software packages \\
%- Collect and filter sensor data \\
%- Receive mission commands (Go-to, Loiter, Hover) \\
%- Transmit mission critical information to ground station \\
%- Execute missions and maintain vehicle stability \\
%
%- Many autopilots are available \\
%- PX4 is an open-source autopilot software that can be ran on a number of hardware platforms including the Pixhawk, PixRacer, Parrot Bebop, and Crazyflie. Integrating the pixhawk firmware into a companion computer is useful because more complex software can be ran on-board as well as multiple computer languages. \\
