% Clarification as to what a vector field is, what a potential field is, etc. Vector field is a space of n dimensions 
% that has an associated vector for each point in space. These vector fields can be constructed in a number of different 
% ways and it is useful to categorize them. In this literature potential fields will describe a vector field that is
% generated by langragian equations and by the principle of least action. Path following vector fields will be in reference
% to vector feilds that converge and follow a pre-defined path. (Then transistion into potential fields and VF discussion, how % they are made, what they are used for, the problems that we face when formulating them)

\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Motivation and Problem Statement}
\section{Methods Overview}
\section{Phases}
\section{Summary of Objectives}
\begin{itemize}

\item Develop a parameterized circulation method that eliminates the singularity and guides a UAV around an obstacle and to a target. The parametrized circulation term $f(heading,closing velocity, position, turn rate)$ and would be determined by minimizing a cost.


\item Simulate and compare the parametrized circulation with a non parametrized VF guidance for circular and elliptical obstacles

\item Emulate fixed wing algorithm with a ground robot to validate simulation results and demonstrate real time VF guidance is achievable with parametrized circulation modification
\end{itemize}

\item Navigation
\item Guidance
\item Path Planning
\item Control
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Flight Mechanics}
\subsection{Autopilot}
\subsection{Simulation}
\subsection{Emulation}

\section{Path Planning}
\begin{itemize}

%In no particular order of importance, all points that should be discussed
\item Current state to goal state while passing through objectives
\item High level obstacle avoidance
\item Line or series of waypoints
\item How vehicle reaches line or points not necessarily considered
\item Responsibility of guidance
\item Avoid collisions, seeking goals
\end{itemize}

\section{Guidance}
\subsection{Potential Field}
\begin{itemize}
\item Potential field (what is it) (edge of bowl, marble, goal, obstacles)
\item Calculation time
\begin{itemize}
\item Long time to calculate
\item Environment changes, entire field has to be regenerated
\item Improvements could be made with better computing methods . . .
\end{itemize}

\item Local minimums
\begin{itemize}
\item Local minimums are a significant area of study in potential field
\item Examples of how the problem is being addressed
\item Common issue across the board - No clear solution in sight
\item As missions become more complex, the problem only worsens
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Vector Field}
\begin{itemize}
\item First appearance of vector field (Histogram approach) [Koren 1989] (read before typing it out)

\item Experiments with sonar sensor robots [Koren and B 1991]

\item \citep{borenstein_real-time_1990} Improvements on previous vector field histogram
\item Ground robot
\item Later work provided improvements
\item Limitations, size of cells, instability and oscillations
\item Problems with VF, used as a general path planner with another local path planner on top 
\item (transition)


\item First instance of generating a field for converging onto paths made of straight line and circular segments (Nelson, Barber, 2006)
\item Field construction of Nelson and Barber (More reading)
\item Added benefit of VF is adding component to counteract wind

\item Cooperative Standoff Tracking of Uncertain moving targets (2007, Frew)
\item VF usefulness extended to loitering about an uncertain target
\item Lyapunov vector field generation for a circular loiter
\item Linear transformation applied to stretch the field into an ellipse shape
\end{itemize}

% Remember to include something about latency and control delay. Adding a look-ahead functionality may improve the performance of the VF guidance
